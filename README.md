# sqlalchemy
This repository contains a Python script for performing a climate analysis and data exploration using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The analysis is based on a provided climate database.

To perform the analysis:

Connect to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.
Reflect the tables into classes and save references to station and measurement.
Create a SQLAlchemy session.
Perform a precipitation analysis:
Find the most recent date in the dataset.
Query the previous 12 months of precipitation data.
Load the results into a Pandas DataFrame and plot them.
Print summary statistics for the precipitation data.
Perform a station analysis:
Calculate the total number of stations.
List stations and their observation counts.
Identify the station with the most observations.
Calculate lowest, highest, and average temperatures for that station.
Query the previous 12 months of temperature observation data for that station and plot as a histogram.
Close the session.
Refer to climate_starter.ipynb for the full implementation and code details.
